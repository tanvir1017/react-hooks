# üëâ1Ô∏è‚É£ useCallback

> > ‚öì `cache the  function between re-renders.useCallback  function let's you cache the function between many re-renders`

```js
const [userInput, setUserInput] = useState("");
const [result, setResult] = useState(0);
const [num] = useState(5);
const [num1] = useState(4);

const sum = useCallback(() => num + num1, [num1, num]);
useEffect(() => {
  console.log(`New sum result is as usual : ${sum()}`);

  // ? Endless loop! For react is so smart, it can detect the same value and not changed anything because of value is same and prevent the loop. So what's going on here‚ùìWe are updating the state by setResult(sum())-(because of sum return a permeative value). When the state change react re-render component. When component re-render() useEffect called and useEffect is looking for [sum] changes and inside of the useEffect we are again change the state by putting sum() inside of setResult(). Again state change when state change react re-render components after re-render useEffect called and blah blah. It could be endless loop like this. But react can detect that value is not changing that's why it's not happing.üöÄ

  setResult(sum());
}, [sum]);
```

```js
const [result, setResult] = useState(0);
const [num] = useState(5);
const [num1] = useState(4);
// without useCallback
const buildArray = () => [num, num1];

// with useCallback. üöÄ Now it's have the referential equality. It will memoized function before the function gives new value or return new value
const buildArray = useCallback(() => [num, num1], [num, num1]);
useEffect(() => {
  console.log(`New array: ${buildArray()}`);

}, []);
```

# üëâ2Ô∏è‚É£ useMemo

> > ‚öì `cache the expensive calculation or value between re-renders. useMemo function let's you cache the expensive function value or expensive calculation between many re-renders.`

## ü™¥ _**Use case**_ Or _**references**_

- Skipping the expensive recalculations
- Skipping the rendering of components
- Memoizing the dependency of another hook
- Memoizing function

```js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";

const fibo = (n) => {
  return n <= 1 ? n : fibo(n - 1) + fibo(n - 2);
};
export default function Memo() {
  const [useNumber, setUseNumber] = useState(0);
  // ?üîñ reference from line number 116 - 126. ü§Ø  Why this states input will slow‚ùìCause from react useState we know that when we change any of state in react app the app will render for every changes. So whenever we type a new word or input it set the input to the randomInput state. ‚öì When it's setting the value app will render ‚öì When render the app the fiboNumber variable call the fibonacci function and regenerate the value again. Also we know that fibonacci function is so expensive about performance. So if you give the long value above the  30 the function will goes to expensive in performance. And lag your app instantly.
  const [randomInput, setRandomInput] = useState("");

  const fiboNumber = fibo(useNumber);
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("fibonacci : ", fiboNumber);
    console.log("random input are taken");
  }, [fiboNumber]);
  return (
    <>
      <hr />
      <h1>useMemo üìù</h1>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="fibonacci-number">Fibonacci number : </label>
        <input
          style={{ padding: ".45rem 1.5rem" }}
          type="text"
          value={useNumber}
          onChange={(e) => setUseNumber(e.target.value)}
        />
        <p style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
          Fibonacci number is: {fiboNumber | "--"}
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="fibonacci-number">Random Input : </label>
        <input
          style={{ padding: ".45rem 1.5rem" }}
          type="text"
          value={randomInput}
          onChange={(e) => setRandomInput(e.target.value)}
        />
        <p style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
          Given random input is : {randomInput}
        </p>
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
```

## ü™¥ **_so what can we do here with useMemo_** ü§î

```js
// ? What exactly going on hereü§î‚ùì  So in this line below we use react hooks called useMemo. Which is memoized the value off fibo function and it will render the application when useNumber dependency will change. So here useMemo element your application lag and do not effect on your application's other actions
const fiboNumber = useMemo(() => fibo(useNumber), [useNumber]);
```

## ü™¥ **_Difference view of the useCallback & useMemoüëÄ_**

```js
// ? So what can we do‚ùì If the expensive function(fibo) is inside the components we can use react hooks called useCallback as we explained it before. We know clearly know that useCallback memoized the function & useMemo memoized the function value. So if you use useCallback hooks when components has some update or state change it should be memoized the expensive function(fibo) & it knows that function has know changes or no new return stuff. It will keep the function as it is and eliminated the laggings form the app
export default function Memo() {
  const fibo = useCallback((n) => {
    return n <= 1 ? n : fibo(n - 1) + fibo(n - 2);
  }, []);

  // ? What exactly going on hereü§î‚ùì So in this line below we use react hooks called useMemo. Which is memoized the value off fibo function and it will render the application when useNumber dependency will change. So here useMemo element your application lag and do not effect on your application's other actions
  const fiboNumber = useMemo(() => fibo(useNumber), [useNumber, fibo]);
}
```

# useRef

> > ‚öì `This hook  let's reference you the value that‚Äôs not needed for rendering.`

## Syntax

```js
import { useRef } from "react";
const inputRef = useRef(initialValue);
```

# **_when we have to use it_** üëà

1. A value frequently changes and it nots require to render the component's. Like an input field which is changes when you type something or delete something by pressing `backspace`.
2. We can use react hook `useRef` Instead of using the state, when the state set every value when client pressing the key, it will re-render the app in every press. useRef will reference the value and doesn't re-render the components.
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Also we can manipulate vanilla js `DOM`. So it's not the right way to manipulate dom in react by vanilla js. React came for building `single page application` by thinking in react-full way. So ti's not the good practice to manipulate `dom` using `useRef`

# useReducer

> > ‚öì `useReducer let's you add `reducer` to you component.`

_**And we also know reducer function reduce your work and give you more flexibility. Instead of using a lot of state ! you can handle all of your functional components state in one reducer function**_

## Let's bring an example by code: üòé

```js
import { useReducer } from "react";

const reducerFunc = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "INCREMENT": {
      return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
    }
    case "DECREMENT": {
      return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 };
    }
    case "R-INPUT": {
      return { ...state, inputText: action.payload };
    }
    case "TG-COLOR": {
      return { ...state, color: !state.color };
    }
    default:
      throw new Error("hey there is problem with your action");
  }
};
export default function Reducer() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducerFunc, {
    count: 0,
    inputText: "",
    color: false,
  });

  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [inputText, setInputText] = useState("");
  const [color, setColor] = useState(false);
```

## Or see the example by a picture, *which is also like this code was mentioned before *ü•±

![useReducer picture example](/public//images//useReducer.png)

# useLayoutEffect

> > ‚öì `useLayoutEffect works before browser repaints the screen.`

## Everything in useEffect and useLayoutEffect is same its syntax, dependency everything. But differences between both them is:

- useEffect is asynchronous and useLayoutEffect is synchronous.
- useEffect is fired after rendered the page or browser paints the screen & useLayoutEffect fired the side effect before browser repaints the screen.
  <br />
  <br />

> Side Effect ‚ùì
>
> > Side effect is something will change inside of the `useEffect` or `useLayoutEffect` if any of the state or something else like dependency (which is given to the hooks [`dependency`]) change on the page.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è useEffect is mostly used instead of useLayoutEffect because useLayoutEffect is hurt the performances. 99% case you will use `useEffect` 1% case you will use `useLayoutEffect`, And the 1% is when you want to not show the changes to the client after render or browser repaints.

# useImperativeHandle

> > ‚öì `useImperativeHandle lets you give access to the child components to the inside of parent components`

. In useImperativeHandle Hooks we need to use two more hooks with useImperativeHandle Hooks.

1.  useRef **_for keep reference the child component function or action_**
2.  forwardRef **_for forwarding the child components to the parents when we export the functional components_**
3.  useImperativeHandle **_This hooks use inside the child components and everything inside of the hooks are available on parent hooks by `ref.current`_**

### when we use this hooks and call the child components from parents we have to add useRef, because this ref will keep the reference from child. Also the child component will take two parameter

1. props **must be in parameter**,
2. ref **which will take the useRef from parents**

üëâ let's bring an example:

<button>Child components</button>

```js
function ModalChild(props, ref) {
  console.log("ref from child", ref);
  const [modalState, setModalState] = useState(false);
  const obje = {
    name: "Tanvir Hossain",
    age: 20,
  };
  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    modalState,
    obje,
    openModal: () => setModalState(true),
  }));

  if (!modalState) return null;
  console.log("child component rendered");
  return <>jsx</>;
}

export default forwardRef(ModalChild);
```

<button>Parent's components</button>

```js
import ModalChild from "./ModalChild";

export default function ImperativeHandle() {
  const modalRef = useRef();

  const handleModalOpenRef = () => {
    modalRef.current.openModal();
  };

  console.log("parent rendered");
  return (
    <>
      <ModalChild ref={modalRef} />
    </>
  );
}
```

# useDebugValue

> > ‚öì `useDebugValue lets you send some informative data to the React DEV__TOOLS, to keep your current status of your code`

# useTransition

> > ‚öì `useTransition . It will lets you update the state without blocking the Ui. It does not take any parameters and returns an array with exactly two items.

1. isPending
2. startTransition function

   The `isPending` flag tells you whether there is a pending function.Another one (`startTransition`) function that let's you update the state without ui blocking as a transition`

This hooks you may use frequently. ‚ö†Ô∏è On more thing is wit will renders many. When you see something (state) is sluggish you app or block the ui then you can use it for instant update the state and show the current status by isPending items

üëâ Let's see an example:

```js
const Transitions = () => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
  const handleToDoTransitions = () => {
    setCounter((prev) => prev + 1);

    startTransition(() => {
      const itemsArray = Array(20000)
        .fill(1)
        .map((el, i) => counter + 20000 - i);
      setItems(itemsArray);
    });
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleToDoTransitions}>{counter}</button>
      {isPending ? <p>loading....</p> : null}
      <ul>
        {items.map((el) => (
          <li key={el}>{el}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};
```
